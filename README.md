## 🚀 Project Tasks and Learning Objectives

### **Task Highlights**
- **Factorial Function** (`factorial.py`): Debugging basic mathematical operations.
- **HTML Background Change** (`change_background.html`): Fixing front-end styling and functionality.
- **Minesweeper Game** (`mines.py`): Debugging complex game logic.
- **Recursive Factorial** (`factorial_recursive.py`): Troubleshooting recursion issues.
- **Checkbook Application** (`checkbook.py`): Debugging a financial application.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** (`tic.py`): Debugging game state management and UI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary language for debugging exercises.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Web development debugging tasks.
- **ChatGPT** - AI assistant for debugging and code analysis.

## ⚙️ Usage and Execution

### Python Scripts
```bash
python3 factorial.py
python3 factorial_recursive.py
python3 checkbook.py
python3 mines.py
python3 tic.py
python3 print_arguments.py arg1 arg2 arg3
```

### HTML/CSS Task
```bash
open change_background.html
# or
firefox change_background.html
```
